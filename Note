-	Repeat simulation: repeat 10-100 times

-	Set-up:
a.	Different eigenfunctions: periodicity
b.	Outcome: binary
c.	Sample size: start with N=500
d.	Grid density: start with J=1000
e.	Bin width, overlap or not: non-overlap, bin width = 10 (100 bins)

1. Stress the target data is "high-dimensional dense repeated measures"
2. Set up a motivation example (like fig.3 in the FCR paper)
3, Develop a prediction interval (SD of scores)
