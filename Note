-	Repeat simulation: repeat 10-100 times

-	Set-up:
a.	Different eigenfunctions: periodicity
b.	Outcome: binary
c.	Sample size: start with N=500
d.	Grid density: start with J=1000
e.	Bin width, overlap or not: non-overlap, bin width = 10 (100 bins)

1. Stress the target data is "high-dimensional dense repeated measures"

2. Set up a motivation example (like fig.3 in the FCR paper)
- add a section in the manuscript
- also format the paper in statistics in medicine format

3. Develop a prediction interval (SD of scores)

- There are a few ways this can be down. We can estimate the score and calculate a wald interval. But I think we probably shouldn't compare the converage to other methods. 
- I am not sure if we need to add in the variantion of mean function, since the variation of scores is estimated conditional on the mean
- Also, I am not sure if we should compare the CI as well
- Another problem: variance of scores seemed to decrease in dramatice scales as more data is added in. Is that suppose to happen? 
- I should look into the intervals of other methods


4. DynPred package? function? 
- Should I priotize this over prediction interval? 

5. Format in statistics in medicine/biometrics format


# 24/7/9
1. Motivation example: add a panel title and (y) axis labels for observed vs predicted
- How to do the split facet title? 

2. Prediction interval:

1) Try to explore the coverage interval
- For LaplaceApproximation, it seems that either probablity interval or standard deviation change dramatically with the estimation (of Hessian matrix) method used. Therefore, I think I should probably turn to stan. 
- what is the different between standard deviation (SD) and monte carlo standard error (mean_se)?
- Results from stan seemed much more resonable, and stable as I change the algorithm/update observed track
- The standard deviation for sure decreased as more data is collected before it

2) Write out how the prediction interval is calculated 
3) Try the out-of-sample prection part in stan
4) Priotize the interval part over pacakge development
